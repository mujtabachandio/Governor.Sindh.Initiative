// Intentional Error: If you havenâ€™t received an array index error in one of your programs yet, try to make one happen. Change an index in one of your programs to produce an index error. Make sure you correct the error before closing the program.

let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];


console.log(numbers[10]); // This line will cause an index error

// To fix the error, we'll change the index to one that exists
console.log(numbers[2]); // Accessing index 2 instead of 10
