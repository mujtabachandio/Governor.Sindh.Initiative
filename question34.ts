// Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!

let colors: string[] = ["Red", "Blue", "Green"];

for (let color of colors) {
    console.log(`The color ${color.toLowerCase()} is vibrant and eye-catching.`);
}

console.log("These colors share the characteristic of being visually appealing ");
